## Details 

### Eclipse 


Eclipse is the common IDE for developers;

This project is codding by java ,so ,eclipse is the choice;

This time ,I use the Eclipse Juno ,You can get the latest version from [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### GAE Plugin 

This is a google app ,so GAE plugin is necessary.

[Here](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse?hl=zh-cn) is the guide .


### Maven

Maven is a effective tool to manage your project.

Use it ,you can get the jars in eatch computers without the version problems.

But it seems like not very useful with GAE Projects ,because these projects should copy all lib into `WEB-INF/lib` folder ,but maven also download the jars to the repertory .Anyway ,maven is also a effective tool in team work ,and it can help you download java docs and source codes when you use the jar.


In this project ,I used Two maven tools:

**maven client**: It's useful and effective.You can download it from [here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) , install to your computer.[ The illustration will be added later]()

**maven eclipse plugin**:It can help you to manage your project in IDE , it is simple and effective.You can download from eclipse ,look at [here](http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html).


### SVN

Also I use Two svn tools.

**TortoiseSVN**:download from [here](http://tortoisesvn.net/). No need to say more.

**Subclipse**:This is an eclipse plugin ,also useful .Come [here](http://subclipse.tigris.org/)
